### Prediction on Car Fuel Efficiency

This application allows you to enter you car specs and make a prediction of the fuel efficiency of you car.


You will need to enter the car specs:

1) Number of Cyclinder

2) Horse Power

3) Car Weight (1000 lbs)

Then, click on the SUBMIT button.

The shiny app will calculate and display the average fuel efficiency (in terms of MPG - Miles Per Gallon) of your car.

**Note:** If you enter an invalid car spec, the apps will not do calulation.
